Gcloud-FrontEnd-Website-Code

### - Description: This is one of two repos as I am starting my very own Google Cloud Resume Challenge.
### - Purpose: This will be used to work primarily on the front end development bits of my resume. I expect to see several revisions of many html, css and js files. 
### - Key features and functionalities: Github Actions need to be mentioned here for CI/CD pipeline development. But since I am not confident that I can clearly explain what CI/CD pipeline is, I would say â€” watch this space as I catch up with the lingo.
